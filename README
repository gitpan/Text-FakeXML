Text-FakeXML
============

Many applications use XML-style data, e.g., for configuration.
However, very often this data is not 'real' XML, but just text with
some XML-like markups. Therefore is it not necessary to pull in the
whole vast XML machinery to create these files. A simple 'fake' module
is sufficient.

For example, consider this real-life config file for eye-of-gnome:

  <?xml version='1.0'?>
  <gconf>
    <entry name='geometry_collection' mtime='1164190071' type='string'>
      <stringvalue>440x350+1063+144</stringvalue>
    </entry>
  </gconf>

This doesn't require anything fancy:

    use Text::FakeXML;
    my $cfg = Text::FakeXML->new(version => "1.0");
    $cfg->xml_elt_open("gconf");
    $cfg->xml_elt("entry", name => "geometry_collection",
                  mtime => "1164190071", type => "string");
    $cfg->xml_elt("stringvalue", "440x350+1063+144" );
    $cfg->xml_elt_close("gconf");

Text::FakeXML does not use any other (non-core) modules.
